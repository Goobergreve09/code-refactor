## Description
I was given code and was asked to refactor the code to all Semantic elements. 
I was to give the webpage full accessibility without changing the outlook of the page at all.
All of the images were also to have easily accessible alt attributes.
The header attributes were also to fall in sequential order. 
In this project I refactored the given code to include all of the above elements.
